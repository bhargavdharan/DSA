# Analysis of Algorithm

## Asymptotic Analysis

**why performance Analysis?**

--- *There are many important things that should be taken care of , like user friendliness,modularity,security,maintainability etc.,*

**why to worry about performance?**

--- *1.we can have all the above things only if we have performance *
--- *2.performance is like currency through which we can buy all the above things*
--- *3.main reason we want performance to speed up the code*

**Given two algorithms for a task,how do we find out which one is better?**

#### -- *one naive way of doing this is - implement both algorithms and run the two programs on your computer for different inputs and see which one takes less time*
#### -- *They are many problems with this approach for analysis of algorithms*
#### --------- *it might be possible that for some inputs,first algorithm performs better than second.And for some inputs second performs better*
#### --------- *it might also be possible for some inputs,first algorithm perform better on one machine and the second works better on other machine for some other inputs*

### **NOTE:** -- Asymptotic analysis is the big idea that handles above issues in analyzing algorithms.
### In Asymptotic Analysis,
###           --- we evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of input size(we don't measure actual running time)
###           --- we calculate, how the time or space taken by algorithm increases with the input size.
