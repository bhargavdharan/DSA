### Real time Example
### *when you building a home you need certain building blocks and raw-materials such as bricks,wooden-plank,metal-rods and top of that we have to apply instructions to build home and you get home as a result*

### How to build software applications?
### *similarly, when u building software applications, u need raw building blocks which are basically data structures such as arrays,linked-list,etc., on top of that we have apply code instructions which operates on DS and as a result we get software applications*

## Data Structures:

### --- *Data structures are building blocks or raw material for any software programs*
### --- *Data structures are containers storing data in a specific memory layout*

## Table of DS in diff langs:

| `DataStructure`     | `Python`          | `java`                | `c++`     |
|---------------------|:-----------------:|:---------------------:|--------:|
| **Array**           |   List            |NativeArray,arrayList  | NativeArray,std::vector
| **Hash Table**      |   dictionary      |HashMap,Linked H.M     | std::map
| **Linked List**     |   not available   |LinkedList             | std::list

## In python Data structures is defined in two ways:
#### ---1.Built-in DS(list,tuple,set,Dictionary)
#### ---2.user defined DS(stack,queue,linked list,tree,graph)


## Big O Notations

### --- *Big O notation is used to measure how running time or space requirements for your program grow as input size grows*

### -- Measuring for time growth


### -- Measuring for space growth
